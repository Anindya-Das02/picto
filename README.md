# Introduction

Picto is a simple photo sharing app created using React JS and PHP. The authorized user can post pictures, like others post.
The main purpose of this project was to learn ```React JS``` and how it interacts with the backend technologies, therefore this app (in its current version) misses few features such as  commenting on post, deleting a post, forget password, etc. These missing features will be added in its new version.

**current version:** 1.0


# Technologies Used

**Front-end:** React JS, Bootstrap  
**Back-end:** PHP, MySQL
