# Introduction

Picto is a simple photo sharing app created using React JS and PHP. The authorized user can post pictures, like others post.
The main purpose of this project was to learn ```ReactJS``` and how it interacts with the backend technologies, therefore this app (in its current version) misses few features such as  commenting on post, deleting a post, forget password, etc. These missing features will be added in its new version.

**version:** 1.0
